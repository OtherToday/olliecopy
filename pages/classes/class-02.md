## Fictional Worlds

The class presented images from the worlds they'd described from last weeks' assignment. The worlds presented included:

- One Piece (1997), Eiichiro Oda
- MORE

## Exercises: Real world

This week we‚Äôll be thinking about objects ‚Äì things that are meaningful to us, the worlds they come from, and how they are presented. Please note, we will be dealing with objects that carry meaning for other people. Please be respectful of their objects, and treat them with care.

You were asked to bring an object into class. Please take it out of your bag and put it on the table. Don‚Äôt talk about your objects.

_Please note: in the following exercises, the writing is just a tool to help you think ‚Äì please write in whatever language or medium helps you think the best. If it's useful to use something like a voice memo app instead of writing, please do!_

### ‚è∞Ô∏è5-minute exercise: Writing about your object

Describe the object in front of you. What does it mean to you? Why did you bring it in today? Think about the world it comes from; how you first acquired it; the places you‚Äôve been with it. Where does it normally live? How would you feel if you lost it?

### ‚è∞Ô∏è5-minute exercise: Writing about someone else's object

Move around the table one place. You now have someone else‚Äôs object in front of you. Describe it as fully as you can. What is it? What is it made from? How large is it? What does it do? Why do you think it‚Äôs significant?

### ‚è∞Ô∏è10-minute exercise: Describing objects

Please describe your partner‚Äôs object to them in objective terms. What is it?

You are only allowed to describe your partner‚Äôs object. Do not tell your partner what the significance of your object is.

Whilst you are describing the object, observe their reaction. How objectively do you think they see the object? What significance does it have to them?

How does it feel to have your meaningful object described to you?

### üí¨Ô∏èDiscussion

How does it feel to have your object described to you?

## Exercise: Fictonal contents

Place your object in an envelope, and take a cue card.

Cue cards have the following messages:

- This object is sacred.
- This is the LAST ONE in the world. Treat it with care.
- The thing in this envelope can control people, but nobody can know.
- This is totally illegal. Keep it hidden.
- This envelope contains critical evidence in a murder case.
- If this object goes below shoulder height, it will explode.

You must follow the instructions on the cue card, and give the envelope to someone else. You cannot reveal what is on the card. How do you give them the envelope?

When you receive an envelope, how did you know its significance? Did its contents meet your expectations? How could you have made the back-story more believable?

## Presentation

Finally, present your objects to the class. We'll have a small discussion about what they are, and why they have significance.

# Assignments

There is one assignment for next class:

## Designing a ritual

By next class, you must design and document a ritual around an object. The ritual can be real or imagined, and take place anywhere. The only constraints are that the documentation must be entirely non-verbal. You can make a film, take photos, draw, perform ‚Äì any medium you see fit.

Upload your film üëâÔ∏è[HERE](https://forms.gle/EAgU2Gia9EhzNy1y8) before Thursday evening!

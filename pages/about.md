# Course overview

World-building is a valuable tool in art and design. The ability to immerse an audience in a complete world is crucial to the framing of TV shows and movies; corporations, nations, political parties, theatrical productions, and futurists all engage in ‘world-building’. What can artists and designers learn from world-building to enhance and augment their own practice?

This 10-week elective module enables students to explore the worlds of world-building through a structured series of individual and group activities. The course is practice-led, consisting of structured design activities, and seminars (which always lead to a design outcome). The course encourages students to build on skills they already have, enhancing their current practice and projects by creating worlds to embed them in.

We will be using philosopher Maurizio Ferraris’ concept of ‘social objects’ to create artefacts, and imagined social and individual memories. We will use theory and techniques from numerous places – theatre, counterfactuals, psychological operations, fiction, television and film production, propaganda, situationism – as well as testing new methods for world-building. By the end of the course, students will have designed maquettes and small sets, artefacts from imagined worlds, and produced a short film, audio production, performance, or related project. The course is methods-focused, but will also provide supplementary reading materials for students who wish to integrate these methods into their practice.

The course will be performed in public: the syllabus and assignments will be made open source, and the course will culminate in a public exhibition (venue to be confirmed).

## Teaching and participation

Seminars, workshops, presentations, and studio teaching.

We meet on Fridays from 14.00-17.00 in the Seminar Room on the third floor. You are expected to attend all classes. If you cannot make it to class please email [om.palmer@avans.nl](mailto:om.palmer@avans.nl) in advance. Failure to attend 2 classes, or the assessment at the end of the course is grounds for failing the course (with the exception of emergencies).

The total time allocated for a 3EC course is 84 hours. This means that in addition to attending classes, you are also expected to carry out around 4-5 hours’ work on your assignments outside of class time.

There will be activities, conversations, presentations, feedback, and group work in class. Please try to engage with these activities as fully as possible. If for any reason you feel uncomfortable with any of these activities please let your tutor know.

## Marking

Your work will be graded on 29th May 2020 by a panel consisting of your tutor and 1-2 other people. You will be awarded a grade according to the standard MIVC criteria for assessing work.

## Inclusivity

This course is designed to further your creativity and allow you to explore new ideas, techniques, and concepts.

In order to do this, we need to make sure that everybody feels able to express themselves in a safe environment. At AKV St Joost we embrace an atmosphere of creativity which is enriched and enhanced by diversity along a number of dimensions, including race, ethnicity and national origins, gender and gender identity, sexuality, class and religion. We are especially committed to increasing the representation of those populations which have historically been excluded from participation in Dutch higher education.

It is critical that each class member show respect for all world-views expressed in class. If you feel that something said or done in class is troubling or has caused discomfort, please contact Ollie confidentially. If you would like to speak to someone outside of the classroom, please contact Study Coach [Rosie Heinrich](https://www.akvstjoostmasters.nl/community/tutors/rosie-heinrich).

If you have a name or pronoun which differs from the one we have on record, please let me know. Like many people, I am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities, and am always eager to hear from students how I can improve in this respect.

If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please speak to Ollie or Rosie. Ollie is also available for individual tutorials on Fridays outside of class for students across MIVC.

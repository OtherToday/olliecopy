# Course overview


World-building is a valuable tool in art and design. The ability to immerse an audience in a complete world is crucial to the framing of TV shows and movies; corporations, nations, political parties, theatrical productions, and futurists all engage in ‘world-building’. What can artists and designers learn from world-building to enhance and augment their own practice?

This 10-class elective module enables students to explore the worlds of world-building through a structured series of individual and group activities. The course is practice-led, consisting of structured design activities, and seminars (which always lead to a design outcome). The course encourages students to build on skills they already have, enhancing their current practice and projects by creating worlds to embed them in.

We will be using philosopher Maurizio Ferraris’ concept of [social objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentality) to create artefacts, and imagined social and individual memories. We will use theory and techniques from numerous places – theatre, [counterfactuals](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/counterfactuals/), [psychological operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_operations_(United_States)), fiction, television and film production, propaganda, [situationism](https://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/situ.html) – as well as testing new methods for world-building. By the end of the course, students will have designed maquettes and small sets, artefacts from imagined worlds, and produced a short film, audio production, performance, or related project. The course is methods-focused, but will also provide supplementary reading materials for students who wish to integrate these methods into their practice.

Please note that the scope of the course, the mode of teaching, and the expected outputs have changed since the beginning of the course in reaction to the global COVID-19 crisis. [MIVC](https://www.akvstjoostmasters.nl/) is based in the Netherlands, and our school's building has been closed since mid-March 2020. The upside of this is that the mode of disseminating our work has become a [podcast](/podcast), which anyone in the world can listen to for free, and where we will disseminate our students' work at the end of the course.

The course will be performed in public: the syllabus and assignments will be made open access at [parallel.olliepalmer.com](https://parallel.olliepalmer.com), as well as in the [course podcast](/podcast) – which is where students from MIVC will share their work at the end of the course.

# Course guidelines

## Teaching and participation

A new podcast episode, with 15-20 minutes' writing and world-building exercises, is released every weekday during term-time. A longer podcast is released once a week, with issues that will be discussed in class.

MIVC students meet on Fridays from 14.00-17.00 ~in the Situation Room on the first floor of the Masters Institute~ **online**! You are expected to attend all classes. If you cannot make it to class please email [om.palmer@avans.nl](mailto:om.palmer@avans.nl) in advance. Normally, failure to attend 2 classes, or the assessment at the end of the course is grounds for failing the course (with the exception of emergencies) – although there is increased leniency during the current situation.

The total time allocated for a 3EC course is 84 hours. This means that in addition to attending classes, you are also expected to carry out around 4-5 hours’ work on your assignments outside of class time.

There will be activities, conversations, presentations, feedback, and group work in class. Please try to engage with these activities as fully as possible. If for any reason you feel uncomfortable with any of these activities please let your tutor know.

## Marking

Your work will be graded on 29th May 2020 by a panel consisting of your tutor and 1-2 other people. You will be awarded a grade according to the standard MIVC criteria for assessing work.

## Inclusivity

This course is designed to further your creativity and allow you to explore new ideas, techniques, and concepts.

In order to do this, we need to make sure that everybody feels able to express themselves in a safe environment. At AKV St Joost we embrace an atmosphere of creativity which is enriched and enhanced by diversity along a number of dimensions, including race, ethnicity and national origins, gender and gender identity, sexuality, class and religion. We are especially committed to increasing the representation of those populations which have historically been excluded from participation in Dutch higher education.

It is critical that each class member show respect for all world-views expressed in class. If you feel that something said or done in class is troubling or has caused discomfort, please contact Ollie confidentially. If you would like to speak to someone outside of the classroom, please contact Study Coach [Rosie Heinrich](https://www.akvstjoostmasters.nl/community/tutors/rosie-heinrich).

If you have a name or pronoun which differs from the one we have on record, please let me know. Like many people, I am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities, and am always eager to hear from students how I can improve in this respect.

If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please speak to Ollie or Rosie. Ollie is also available for individual tutorials on Fridays outside of class for students across MIVC.

## Assessment criteria

Assessment criteria for the final examination will be announced in due time for you to prepare for the assessment itself (29 May). The criteria will be in line with the other elective modules in the Master Institute; after the assessment you will be given a pass/fail grade, and written feedback.

The class before assessment is dedicated to 1:1 (and if applicable, group) tutorials to help you get the best out of the assessment.

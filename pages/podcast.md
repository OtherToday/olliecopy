## Podcast

We now have a podcast! Full descriptions and transcripts of each extended podcast can be found here, and every exercise . In the meantime, you can subscribe via nearly all of the main podcast channels [here](https://anchor.fm/olliepalmer), and leave a voice message for the show [here](https://anchor.fm/olliepalmer/message) (contributions may be used in future episodes).

There are two types of podcast episode:

**Long episodes***

These introduce a topic or idea, the equivalent of a lecture or talk in class. They're about 20-40 minutes long, and introduce a field or set of ideas like a spoken essay. There is one long episode per class.

***Short episodes***

These are episodes filled with exercises that you can do every day, which build on the ideas presented in the long episodes. They should take 10-20 minutes to do and listen to. Episodes are released every weekday (but not during weeks when there is no class!).
